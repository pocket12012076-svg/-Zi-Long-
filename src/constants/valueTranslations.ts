                q: "妳的故事中似乎看不到希望，是因為妳觀察到這社會對受害者要求很高，例如要活得勵志，或是對受害者的表現有一定的看法？",
                a: "是的，我不想寫得太完美（簡單），我所謂的完美是，好像你只要求救了就會有人理你；你只要說「不」，對方就會停止；或是只要找到對的人就能獲獲救。因為在現實中，根本不會是那樣。\n其中一個令人失望的事，是社會對受傷的人有太多期待，總認為唯一出路是「活得勵志」，一旦你做不到，就被認為是你的問題。這讓我意識到其實很多人只是想看戲。這種期待會讓痛苦的人更困惑，因為總有人認為你活得不夠勵志，或認為你不可能這麼快走出來。但這其實都是一種「暗示」，我們都是在家庭和社會的暗示下長大，如果意識到自己的行為是受他人暗示的驅使，那麼脫掉這層外衣是必要的。只要察覺到了，你就有選擇權。"

                a: "因為不是每個人的自覺能力都很強，每個人都有盲點，但透過自覺你的盲點會越來越小。回歸到你問的，舉例來說：「你會一直跟別人強調你有一對雙眼嗎？」當你出生時就和其他人一樣擁有一對雙眼，你會一直向人說：「我有一對眼睛喔」。在我的觀察裡人不會過度強調事實，那對方又為什麼要這樣做？我認為那才是該去思考的部分。"

                a: "有時候你的善良不被信任，也許是因為對方都是以惡待人。就跟鏡子一樣，對方把自己的行為套用在你身上，然後以此去預判和批評你，但對方不了解真正的你。此時你不需要多想為什麼總是解釋不清或是怎麼做都達不到對方的要求，你只需要意識到：「他正在防備他自己內心那個惡的投影。」轉身離開吧，因為你不可能期望鏡子做出和你不同的動作。\n這其實就回歸到我在「關於我成為作家的10個QA」的Q7所說的「當有人比你更了解你時，處境會變得很危險」，只是現在角色對調了過來。"

                a: "那句「我們知道自己是誰，所以不需要名字」就是我想說的「自我察覺」。這社會充滿了想幫你命名（暗示）的人，他們懷疑你的情緒，又要求你樂觀，甚至表現得比你還懂該怎麼痛。若你允許這些「名字」在身上紮根，你就離真正的自己越遠。\n透過自我察覺，我奪回了定義權。當我足夠了解自己，我就不再需要依賴別人給的名字，也有能力判斷對方的「行為」究竟是真心，還是純粹的惡意。\n我對人性其實是相當悲觀的。因為人終究是動物，在弱肉強食的潛意識基因裡，求救會被視為弱的表現。這也是危險所在——當你釋放弱點時，有些人會意識到你是可以被欺負的，甚至把求救者當成笨蛋，趁機操控你。但求救有很多種呈現方式，不一定都要傷痕累累、楚楚可憐. 有時候受傷太重，就像身體遭受重創，你連回應的力氣都沒有。這種「沉默的呼救」，其實很少人能看得出來。"

                a: "首先我要說關於「愛」沒有一定的答案，只是在我的觀察中有些人在原生家庭中學到的愛是錯的。有人可能認為愛是控制、是改變、是犧牲，或是給予金錢，這也是為什麼有許多啃老族在父母要求他獨立時，他會感到不安，或是看見父母把錢給了別人，他會感到憤怒。\n再來，網路上曾有人說：「你的原生家庭會影響你選擇的另一半」這句話沒有錯，但我關心的是：「那接下來呢？」預判自己的選擇可以說是命、是上帝給的劇本內容，但既然知道自己容易這樣，那就需要察覺了。透過各種方式了解自己很好，但要繼續思考。\n最後，當你的原生家庭是地獄級別的，如果還有人用情緒勒索的方式要你回家，把戲演到「快樂結局」時，例如「父母沒把你丟在路邊」，請遠離這樣要求你的人，他們的道德觀和施暴者沒兩樣。我們感謝父母給我們生命這個事實，但也不要為了自己想擁有平安長大的權利而感到愧疚。接著再以情勒者所說的邏輯把自己給供起來好好養著，感謝自己還活著。"

                a: "Yes, I don't want to write too perfectly (simply). My so-called perfection is as if someone will care as long as you ask for help; as long as you say 'no', the other party will stop; or as long as you find the right person, you can be saved. Because in reality, it's not like that at all.\nOne of the disappointing things is that society has too many expectations for injured people, always thinking the only way out is to 'live inspirationally'. Once you can't do it, it's considered your problem. This made me realize that many people just want to watch the show. This expectation will make suffering people more confused, because someone always thinks you are not living inspirationally enough, or thinks you can't come out so quickly. But this is actually a kind of 'suggestion'. We all grow up under the suggestions of family and society. If you realize that your behavior is driven by others' suggestions, then taking off this coat is necessary. As long as you notice it, you have the right to choose."

                a: "Because not everyone has strong self-awareness, everyone has blind spots, but through self-awareness, your blind spots will become smaller and smaller. Returning to your question, for example: 'Will you keep emphasizing to others that you have a pair of eyes?' When you are born with a pair of eyes like everyone else, you won't keep saying to people: 'I have a pair of eyes'. In my observation, people don't over-emphasize facts, so why would the other party do that? I think that's the part that should be thought about."

                a: "Sometimes your kindness is not trusted, perhaps because the other party treats everyone with malice. Just like a mirror, the other party applies their own behavior to you, and then uses it to predict and criticize you, but the other party doesn't understand the real you. At this time, you don't need to think too much about why you can't always explain clearly or how you can't meet the other party's requirements. You just need to realize: 'He is guarding against the projection of evil in his own heart.' Turn around and leave, because you can't expect the mirror to make a different movement from you.\nThis actually returns to what I said in Q7 of '10 QAs on How I Became a Writer': 'When someone understands you better than you do, the situation becomes very dangerous', it's just that the roles are reversed now."

Sometimes suffering malice is not the victim's problem, but caused by the other party's behavioral deviation. That is to say, if it were someone else today, the event would still happen. So in my novel, I think angels come to the human world to suffer for mankind."

                a: "That sentence 'We know who we are, so we don't need names' is what I mean by 'self-awareness'. This society is full of people who want to help you name (suggest) yourself. They doubt your emotions, demand you to be optimistic, and even act like they know how to hurt better than you. If you allow these 'names' to take root in you, you are further away from the real you.\nThrough self-awareness, I took back the right to define. When I understand myself enough, I no longer need to rely on the names given by others, and I have the ability to judge whether the other party's 'behavior' is sincere or pure malice.\nI am actually quite pessimistic about humanity. Because humans are ultimately animals, in the subconscious genes of the law of the jungle, asking for help will be seen as a sign of weakness. This is also where the danger lies—when you release your weaknesses, some people will realize that you can be bullied, and even treat the help-seeker as a fool, taking the opportunity to manipulate you. But there are many ways to ask for help, not necessarily all scarred and pitiful. Sometimes the injury is too heavy, just like the body suffering a heavy blow, you don't even have the strength to respond. This 'silent cry for help' is actually rarely seen by people."

She realized that this home didn't need her, so she met the mother's suggestion and stayed far away from them, but neither of them was wrong.\nAs I said, 'people grow up under suggestions'.

This is also why many people who live off their parents feel uneasy when their parents ask them to be independent, or feel angry when they see their parents giving money to others.\nFurthermore, someone on the Internet once said: 'Your original family will affect the partner you choose'. This sentence is not wrong, but what I care about is: 'What's next?' Predicting your choice can be said to be fate, the script content given by God, but since you know you are prone to this, you need to be aware. It's good to understand yourself through various ways, but keep thinking.\nFinally, when your original family is at the hell level, if someone still uses emotional blackmail to ask you to go home and play the play to a 'happy ending', such as 'parents didn't throw you on the roadside', please stay away from such people who demand you. Their morality is no different from that of the abuser. We thank our parents for the fact that they gave us life, but don't feel guilty for wanting to have the right to grow up peacefully. Then, according to the logic said by the emotional blackmailer, provide for yourself well and be thankful that you are still alive."

                a: "Emotion is an instinctive reaction, and it's normal for humans as animals to be unable to control instinct. But emotion brings power, that power can drive our behavior and can also hurt ourselves.\nSo when the facts of the past pain come to attack you again, the only thing you can do is to be honest with that emotion—or 'let it go': 'I was just like this', 'I just encountered something'.\nThe moment you admit it, emotion can no longer control your behavior or attack your thoughts, and the pressure will be relieved instead. Next, we can talk about so-called facing and letting go."

If self-awareness can be so fast that it becomes a subconscious reflex action, you will find that besides pain and anger, many other emotions are submerged by these intense emotions.

Pain is an opportunity for you to notice what influence you suffered in the past. That is the opportunity for you to understand yourself. Your body is calling you for help, like a child who can't speak and only makes you feel uncomfortable. So your rationality must realize this discomfort, let this unpleasantness be seen, and admit it, so that you can catch yourself."

But this praise of greatness has instead become ironclad evidence of human inherent evil, as said in Q5: 'people don't over-emphasize facts'. Therefore, in Q2, I emphasized 'let the sensibility admit the existence of darkness, and at the same time let the rationality guard that little bit of acquired choice of goodness'.\nOr perhaps, people are blind and just follow blindly.
